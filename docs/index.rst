PicoPew is an add-on that turns your `TinyPICO <https://www.tinypico.com/>`_ ESP32 development board into a tiny `MicroPython <https://micropython.org/>`_-powered game console compatible with the `PewPew <https://hackaday.io/project/159733-pewpew-standalone>`_ family of devices by Radomir Dopieralski.
